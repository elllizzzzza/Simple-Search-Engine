# Simple-Search-Engine

📘 Simple Search Engine

A simple command-line search engine built in Java that supports efficient full-text search through multiple lines of structured or unstructured data using an inverted index. It features interactive querying with multiple search strategies, file input support, and cleanly modularized logic.

🔍 Description

This project is a step-by-step implementation of a basic yet functional search engine. It allows searching for specific keywords across a list of data entries such as names, emails, addresses, or book details. The system is designed to be case-insensitive and space-insensitive, and it evolves across multiple development stages to introduce new capabilities.

🚀 Features

Search for exact words with 1-based indexing

Multi-line data support with case-insensitive substring matching

Menu-driven CLI for better usability

Read data from an input file instead of the console

Efficient word lookup using an inverted index

Multiple search strategies:

ALL – match lines containing all search terms

ANY – match lines containing any of the search terms

NONE – exclude lines containing any of the search terms
